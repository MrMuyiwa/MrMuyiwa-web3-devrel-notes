> Where broken onboarding flows go to get roasted â€” and rebuilt.

## What's This?

Most Web3 dev docs feel like they were written *by a protocol engineer... for themselves.*

This repo is where I:
- Document pain points while onboarding into popular Web3 tools
- Log unfiltered feedback on dev experience (DX), docs, and tooling
- Propose UX and content improvements, from a DevRel POV

## Structure

- `tools/` â†’ Per-tool folders (Lens, XMTP, etc.)
- `issues/` â†’ Raw onboarding reports
- `proposals/` â†’ Structured fix suggestions

## Tools I'm Reviewing

- [ ] Lens Protocol
- [ ] XMTP
- [ ] WalletConnect v3
- [ ] Lit Protocol

## Each tool gets:
- A friction log (just like user testing, but from a devâ€™s eyes)
- Screenshots of confusing UI or broken flows
- PRs proposing doc updates, UI tweaks, etc.
