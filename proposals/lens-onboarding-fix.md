# Proposal: Fix Lens Protocol Onboarding

## Summary

Too many assumptions baked into the docs:
- Requires GraphQL familiarity
- No starter app, no SDK overview
- Starts at “Step 3” with no steps 1–2

## Fix

- Add "Who is this for?" page
- Provide a working example repo or sandbox
- Create an "Instant Preview" (StackBlitz, Glitch, Replit)
- Add inline comments in sample code

## Benefits

- Smoother DX = more adoption
- Devs won't bounce after hitting the wall
