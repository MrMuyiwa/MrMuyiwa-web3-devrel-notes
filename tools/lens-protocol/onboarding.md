# Lens Protocol – Onboarding Field Notes

## Date: 2025-05-12

## ⚠️ Pain Points

- Docs start mid-flight — no context for what Lens *is* or why I’d use it
- Requires GraphQL knowledge without explanation
- “Quickstart” skips wallet setup and contract context

## Quotes from Docs

> "To publish a post, call `createPostTypedData`"  
... okay but... from where? With what keys? How?

## Suggested Fixes

- Add a “Start Here” based on experience level
- Use live sandboxes (StackBlitz / Glitch / Replit)
- Docs should talk like humans, not compilers

## 🧠 DevRel POV

If your onboarding makes smart devs feel dumb, they leave.
